SRE-Bench Task 3: Full Remediation Grader
Difficulty: Hard | Max Steps: 15 | Expected Score: 0.15 – 0.30

Grades agent's complete incident remediation using:
  - LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) of action sequence vs gold (0.50 weight)
  - Behavior penalties for destructive/random actions (0.30 weight)
  - Verification bonus (0.20 weight)

All matching is deterministic — no LLM-as-judge.
